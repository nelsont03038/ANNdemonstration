Artificial Neural Network Demonstration

This is a demonstration of artificial neural networks.  Here I use ANN to create a predictive classifier.  The example is using data from a bank about its customers.  The customers either leave the bank (churn) or stay at the bank.  The ANN classifier is trained on the data, and can then be used to accurately predict if a customer will leave or not (chrun modelling).  The implementation is in Python, and I use the Keras module for the ANN building (uses Tensorflow backend).  You'll also need pandas and scikit-learn.
